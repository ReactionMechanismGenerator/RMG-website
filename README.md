# RMG Website - A Django-powered website for RMG

This repository contains the source code that powers the RMG website, which 
runs at http://rmg.mit.edu/. The RMG website itself uses the 
[Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework.

## User Setup

If you only wish to *use* the RMG website, no setup is required! Simply point
your favorite web browser to http://rmg.mit.edu/ to get started. Some parts of
the web site require that Javascript be enabled.

## Developer Setup

Running RMG-website requires a working installation of 
[RMG-Py](http://github.com/ReactionMechanismGenerator/RMG-Py). 
Development of the website closely mirrors that of RMG-Py, and you will 
generally need to update the RMG-Py repository whenever you update 
this repository.

For detailed instructions on setting up a local version of RMG-website, 
please see the [wiki page](https://github.com/ReactionMechanismGenerator/RMG-Py/wiki/Setting-up-RMG-website) 
in RMG-Py.
