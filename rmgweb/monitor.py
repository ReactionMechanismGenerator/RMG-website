# This code is cribbed from

# Updated Apr 17, 2011 by Graham.Dumpleton@gmail.com
#
# The use of signals to restart a daemon process could also be employed in a
# mechanism which automatically detects changes to any Python modules or
# dependent files. This could be achieved by creating a thread at startup which
# periodically looks to see if file timestamps have changed and trigger
# a restart if they have.
#
# Example code for such an automatic restart mechanism which is compatible with
# how mod_wsgi works is shown below.
